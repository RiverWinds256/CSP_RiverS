        <h2>The life story of Henri, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Backround</h3>
        <p>The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a recreation of the King Charles Spaniel as an attempt to bring the royal breed back from extinction by Roswell Eldridge in 1926. This new “cavalier” of the King Charles breed was bred using spaniels whose features were reminiscent of a King Charles. This breed was recognized separately from the Kings Charles by the AKC in 1996. Cavaliers range in size from 13-18 pounds typically, but can be much larger. They are well known for their floppy ears and begging eyes, coming in colors such as Ruby, Tricolor, and Blenheim.</p> <br>

        <h3>The beginning</h3>
        <p>Herni was born in March 2023, and went to his forever home in July of the same year. He is a 28 pound Bleiem who is nearly twice as tall as he should be. He was the biggest of his siblings, having learnt to mimic a vacuum during mealtimes, which is a skill he still possesses. From the time he was born, he had a fascination with the world: feathers, cats, and bugs were his favorite. The moment he entered his new home, he attempted to befriend a cat, which didn't go as well as he had hoped. The early years were rather uneventful. </p>
